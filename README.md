## Known Issues
* Grid layout isn't working in Edge/IE. With a bit more time I could cater to their "special needs".
* The images could be better tuned for efficeincy.
* I was shooting for nifty play-button overlays on the thumbnails, but they weren't working out, but they weren't working out.
* I intended to hook in a data service to provide news item and article data from one place, but ran out of time. All the content is injected into the components, so it would be a simple matter to hook it up the rest of the way.
* I failed to include the dancing baby.
